Wiki page storage

Each wiki page is a file in the wiki storage directory. A wiki page "Foo"
corresponds to a file called "Foo.wiki" in the "wikidata" directory.

Character encoding

Wiki pages are stored as UTF-8 text files.  If the site is properly
configured, the wiki properly allows the use of UTF-8 content in wiki
pages.  Since wiki page names map directly to filenames on disk, page
names containing non 7-bit ASCII might not work well.
