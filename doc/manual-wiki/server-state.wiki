= Sessions and server side state =

<<outline depth="2"| <<header| **Table of contents** >> >>

== Introduction ==

<<paragraph| Different scopes for data and services >>

The server-side state of an application refers to data stored on
server side that could be shared by all clients, or that could be
specific to a limited //scope// such as:

* the site
* a session,
* a group of sessions (for example all sessions of the same user),
* a client-side process (when programming an Eliom app), or
* the current request.

For a given scope, server-side state consists of:

* //services// registered with this specific scope, and
* data encapsulated within an //Eliom reference// created with this
  specific scope.
* Bus, channels, etc. (actually implemented using services and Eliom references)

States disappear either when the associated scope is discarded
explicitely or by a timeout.

<<paragraph| Scope and cookies >>

On a technical point of view, sessions and groups of sessions are
implemented automatically within Eliom by asking the browser to send a
session identifier in a cookie. Client-side processes also send an
identifier in each request, using some kind of "client-side
process-cookie".

It is possible to create different scopes of the same level if you
want several states for the same application (advanced use). Each
scope uses its own cookies and you can discard data for one scope
only.

<<paragraph| Secure cookies >>

States can be secure or not. Secure means that the state data or service
will be associated to a secure cookie, that is a cookie that is sent
by the browser only if the protocol is HTTPS. Use secure states to access
confidential data, that you do not want to send through HTTP.

<<paragraph| Three kind of states >>

In the current implementation, because of some limitation in OCaml's
serialization mechanism, there are three kinds of states (for each
scope):

* volatile data states,
* volatile service states,
* persistent data states.

Volatile states will not survive after relaunching the server.  There
is no persistent service state. Be very careful if you use both
persistent state data and service state, as your session may become
inconsistent (use service states only for volatile services, like
coservices with timeouts).

We hope to simplify this when OCaml's serialization mechanism evolves.
In the meantime, be very careful where you store your data.
To avoid shutting down the server, note that it is possible
to ask the server to load dynamically new versions of your site
(see <<a_manual chapter="workflow-configuration" fragment="reload"|command {{{reload}}} >>).



==@@id="scopes"@@ Scopes, cookies and sessions ==

<<outline depth="2">>

=== Basics ===

Eliom uses a notion of //scopes// to restrict the visibility of
server-side data to some clients. Together with <<a_manual
chapter="server-state" fragment="eref"|Eliom references>>, this is a very
convenient way to implement a mechanism of session for your website.

There are two categories of scopes:

* //Eliom scopes//, that consist in:
** <<a_api| val Eliom_common.global_scope >>: for data
   shared by all clients,
** <<a_api| val Eliom_common.site_scope >>: for data
   and services shared by all clients of one eliom site, and
** <<a_api| val Eliom_common.request_scope >>: for
   data specific to the current request.
* //User scopes//: used to restrict the accessibility of a data or a
  service to subset of the clients.

Within the users scopes, Eliom distinguishes three scopes that differ
on how Eliom associates clients and data.

*  Data and dynamic services created with scope
   <<a_api| val Eliom_common.default_session_scope >> are only
  visible to the client belonging to a same session
  (all tabs of a single browser).
* Data and dynamic services created with scope
  <<a_api| val Eliom_common.default_group_scope >> are
  only visible to client whose session belongs to the same session group.
  See section <<a_manual chapter="server-state"
  fragment="session_groups"|Session groups>> for more information.
* Data and dynamic services created with scope
  <<a_api| val Eliom_common.default_process_scope>> are only visible to a specific
  instance of the Eliom application (one tab, running the Eliom client process).
  See section <<a_manual
  chapter="clientserver-applications" fragment="session_groups"|Eliom applications>> for
  more information.

User scopes are organised in //hierarchy//: client processes belong to a
session, and sessions belong to a group of sessions.

Data and dynamic services with a user scope can be discarded
explicitely or by timeout. See sections <<a_manual chapter="server-state"
fragment="closing_sessions"|Closing session>> and <<a_manual
chapter="server-state" fragment="timeouts"|Timeouts and session duration>>
for more information.

If you want to handle multiple sessions for the same site
---~ e.g. several different data sessions that could be created and
discarded independently~ --- you can create new users scope that will use
different cookies, see section <<a_manual chapter="server-state"
fragment="new_scope" |Hierarchies of scopes>> for more information.




=== Creating sessions and scopes ===

==== Automatic session creation ====

Eliom automatically creates a session ---~ and sets the corresponding
cookie on the client~ --- when you first modify an Eliom reference of
scope <<a_api text="session" | val Eliom_common.default_session_scope >>, when you
register a service with this scope or when you enter a session group.

By default, Eliom is using three cookies for sessions (and session groups):

* one for session services,
* one for volatile session data,
* one for persistent session data.

For client side processes, it uses the same three kinds of client side
process cookies.

====@@id="new_scope"@@ Hierarchies of scopes and multiple sessions (advanced use) ====

If you want to handle multiple sessions for the same site that could
be created and discarded independently, you can create a new hierarchy of
users scope that will use different cookies, with the function <<a_api
| val Eliom_common.create_scope_hierarchy >>.

<<code language="ocaml"|
let custom_session_hierarchy = Eliom_common.create_scope_hierarchy "custom"
let custom_session = `Session custom_session_hierarchy
>>

Then, the value {{{custom_session}}} could replace the usual <<a_api |
val Eliom_common.default_session_scope>> for the {{{~scope}}} parameter of functions
<<a_api | val Eliom_reference.eref>>, <<a_api| val
Eliom_registration.Html5.register >>, <<a_api| val Eliom_state.discard >>,~ ...

(Same for {{{`Client_process}}} or  {{{`Session_group}}} scope levels).

The function <<a_api | val
Eliom_common.create_scope_hierarchy >> will prevent you to create
two scope hierarchies with the same name.

=====Example of use:

A typical use of hierarchies is to have one hierarchy for connected users
(the default hierarchy),
and one independent from connection. Use the first one to save user
related content. It will be discarded when the user logs out.
Use the second one to save data corresponding to one tab or browser, (the user
being connected or not), for example because this data must be available
before the user logs in.


===@@id="closing_sessions"@@ Closing sessions (and other states) ===

To discard a state, use the <<a_api | val Eliom_state.discard >>
function. It will remove all server-side services and data (persistent
or not) for the given scope. Used with
{{{~scope:Eliom_common.default_session_scope}}}, this will close a session. Used
with {{{~scope:Eliom_common.default_group_scope}}}, this will close all
sessions in the group.

It is also possible to discard selectively only services, persistent
data or volatile data (see the <<a_api | module Eliom_state >>
module). But this may be periculous.  Be very careful when doing this,
as you are desynchronizing the three kinds of sessions.

<<wip|

  The behaviour of <<a_api | val Eliom_state.discard >> on a session
  group is subject to discussion and may evolve in future version.

>>

<<div style="font-style: italic"|

  Warnings:

* It is a good idea to close the session when a user tries to connect,
  even if it is already connected.
* You may also want to unset some request-scoped Eliom references when
  discarding a state,
* If your state data contains opened file descriptors, they won't be
  closed by OCaml's garbage collector. Close them yourself!  (for
  example using <<span class="code"|Gc.finalise>>).

>>




===@@id="timeouts"@@ Timeouts and session duration ===

The default timeout for sessions in one hour. Sessions will be
automatically closed after that amount of time of inactivity from the
user. You can change that value for your whole site using the <<a_api
| val Eliom_state.set_global_volatile_state_timeout >>.

There is also a possibility to change the default value for Eliom in
the configuration file like this:

<<code language="ocaml"|
<extension findlib-package="ocsigenserver.ext.eliom">
  <volatiletimeout value="7200"/>
</extension>
>>

In the configuration files the value {{{"infinity"}}} means no
timeout.

<<div style="font-style: italic"|

  That default may be overriden by each site using <<a_api| val
  Eliom_state.set_global_volatile_state_timeout >> or <<a_api| val
  Eliom_state.set_default_volatile_state_timeout >>.  If you want your user
  to be able to set the default in the configuration file for your
  site (between {{{<site>}}} and {{{</site>}}}), you must parse the configuration (using
  <<a_api| val Eliom_config.get_config >> function).  You can also
  change the timeout for a specific user only with the following
  functions: <<a_api | val Eliom_state.set_volatile_data_state_timeout
  >>.  For more details, see the <<a_api | module Eliom_state >>
  module's interface.

>>


===@@id="secure_state"@@ Secure session ===

By default, data and services saved in a session are available to requests
using both http or https protocols. If you want to
keep some state in a //secure session// that are visible only to
client accessing with the https protocol, you may give the optional
parameter {{{~secure:true}}} when calling functions like <<a_api | val
Eliom_reference.eref >>, <<a_api | val Eliom_registration.Html5.register
>>, etc.

Secure sessions are using secure cookies (i.e. Ocsigen Server will ask
the browsers to send the cookie only if the protocol is HTTPS). Thus
it is not possible to access secure references and services if the
user is using http.




===@@id="session_groups"@@ Session groups ===

==== Sharing data between a group of sessions ====

Session group is a kind of scope that allows sharing data or services
between a set of sessions, typically all sessions for given user. For
example, using persistent Eliom references with scope <<a_api| val
Eliom_common.default_group_scope >> is a convenient way to store data about
a user without having to explicitly use an external database.
(Persistent session group states are not discarded when all the sessions are
closed).

A session group is identified by a name. The current session could be
attached to a group of sessions using one of the following functions
---~ depending on the nature of the data you want to share. They take the
session group name as parameter:

* <<a_api | val Eliom_state.set_service_session_group >>
* <<a_api | val Eliom_state.set_volatile_data_session_group >>
* <<a_api | val Eliom_state.set_persistent_data_session_group >>

A session could be only attached to one group at a time, but it is
possible to create multiple sessions for a same client attached to
different groups, see section <<a_manual chapter="server-state"
fragment="new_scope" |Hierarchies of scopes>> for more information.

It's possible to fetch the current session group name of a session, if
any, or to detach a session from a group. See the module <<a_api |
module Eliom_state >> for more information.

==== Limit the number of session within a group ====

The number of sessions in a group is limited. If all sessions are in a
group you will avoid some malicious user to open too many sessions.
If you do not use session groups, the number of sessions is limitated
by IP address, which can be a problem for example if the server is
behind a reverse proxy or if many user are using the same NAT.
That's why we always recommend to set the session group (usually it's the user
name or id).

<<wip| Explain how to change the maximum number of session in a group. >>

==== Close all session of a group ====

Session groups allows the implementation of features like "close all sessions"
for one user (even those opened on other browsers).  Consider the
following scenario: a user logs in from home using a "Remember me on
this computer" feature, which sets a (almost) no-expiration cookie on
his browser and session timeouts of infinity on the server.  The user
goes on vacation, and while logging from a cyber-café, he also sets
the "Remember me" option.  Back home he realises the mistake, and
wishes to do a "global logout", i.e., closing all existing sessions
associated with his user name.

For those kind of usage, it is highly recommended to set a group for
each of the three kinds of states you use (services, volatile data and
persistent data).

To close all sessions from a group, close the group.

See section <<a_manual chapter="server-state" fragment="closing_sessions"
|Closing sessions>> for more information.










==@@id="eref"@@ Eliom references ==

=== Principles ===

//Eliom references// (//erefs//) are some kind of references with
a (possibly) limited <<a_manual chapter="server-state"
fragment="scopes"|scope>>. You declare a reference with an initial
value and a scope. Then, when you change the associated value, it
actually changes only for the scope you specified.

Eliom references can be persistent or not (that is: can survive after
relaunching the server or not).

Eliom references are used for example:

* to store session data, server side data for a client process, or
  user data (scope: session, client process, session group),
* or to keep some information about the current request (scope:
  request), for example to give information to the service taking in
  charge the request after an action,
* to implement persistent references (scope: global)
* for caching functions (<<a_api | val Eliom_reference.eref_from_fun>>).

Non persistent global Eliom references are equivalent to regular OCaml
references.

Eliom references are either created using the function <<a_api | val
Eliom_reference.eref >>, that works like the usual Ocaml {{{ref}}}
function, but with at least one additional scope parameter.
Or they may be created by the function <<a_api | val
Eliom_reference.eref_from_fun>>: Its argument function is evaluated the first
time the reference is accessed (through <<a_api | val Eliom_reference.get>>),
within one scope or after the reference has been reset.

The <<a_api | module Eliom_reference >> module also defines functions to
<<a_api text="get"| val Eliom_reference.get >> the value, <<a_api
text="set"| val Eliom_reference.set>>, <<a_api text="modify"
| val Eliom_reference.modify>> it (by applying a function to its content), and <<a_api
text="unset"| val Eliom_reference.unset >> it, this is reset to the initial value.

===@@id="persistent_eref"@@ Persistent references ===

Persistent references are Eliom references that survives after
relaunching the server. They are implemented using the <<a_api
project="ocsigenserver" | module Ocsipersist >> module for which
Ocsigenserver provides two implementations, one based on {{{SQLite}}},
the other one based on {{{DBM}}}.

Persistent references are created by adding the {{{~persistent}}}
parameter to the <<a_api | val Eliom_reference.eref >> function
calls. The value of this parameter is the name of the reference in the
database.

<<wip |

Persistent data are serialized on hard drive using OCaml's unsafe
<<span class="code"|Marshal>> module, hence persistent references
currently suffer some limitations:

* It is not possible to serialize closures or services (as we are
  using dynamic linking),
* If you ever change the type of serialised data, don't forget to
  change the persistent reference name, or the server will probably
  crash while deserializing!

>>

==== Volatile references ====

The module <<a_api | module Eliom_reference.Volatile>> allows the creation of
non-persistent Eliom references, which can then be used through a non-Lwt
interface.

As <<a_api | type Eliom_reference.Volatile.eref>> is a subtype of <<a_api |
type Eliom_reference.eref>>, a volatile reference ##eref## may be used
as ##(eref : _ Eliom_reference.eref)## with the Lwt-interface of <<a_api |
module Eliom_reference>> alike.

== Accessing other states

Sometimes, it is useful to access other states.
For example if you want to send a notification to another user,
you may want to find the communication channel registered for this
user. It can probably be found as an Eliom reference in the group
corresponding to this user.

Use module <<a_api | module Eliom_state.Ext>>
to get the state corresponding to a group name.
Use <<a_api | val Eliom_state.Ext.iter_sub_states >>
to iterate on all sessions in a group, or on all client processes
in a session.

Use <<a_api | module Eliom_reference.Ext >>
to access Eliom references belonging to another state.


== Low-level cookies manipulation

Eliom references are used to store data on the server-side. It is also
possible to ask the browser or the client-side process to record some
piece of data and send it back to the server with each request.

This is implemented using the usual browser cookies for sessions ---~ and
a simulation of browser cookies by Eliom client side processes~ --- with
the functions <<a_api | val Eliom_state.set_cookie >> and <<a_api |
val Eliom_state.get_cookie >>.
