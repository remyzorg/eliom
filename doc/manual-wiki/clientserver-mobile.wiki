= Programming mobile applications with Eliom

<<outline depth="2"| <<header| **Table of contents** >> >>

Eliom now has an experimental feature making possible to start the application
from client side, making possible offline or mobile apps.

As this feature is still very young, we still need to understand the needs
of developers to improve it. If you try this, we would be happy to receive your
experience reports.

The experiments we did worked like this:
 * We used Phonegap or Cordoba
 * We provided a default index.html page, that includes the js generated by
Eliom
 * The client side program calls new function
<<a_api project="eliom" subproject="client"|val Eliom_client.init_client_app>>
to initialize the application, that is, mainly, set the default server
that will be used in requests.

More documentation soon ...
